# Uhpenry

**Monetize Private Code. Share Securely. Earn Publicly.**

Uhpenry is a platform that helps developers sell and monetize private software, tools, and full codebases. Built on top of GitHub and Stripe, it introduces a new model called **Gated-Source** — a flexible, secure way to share code without fully open-sourcing it.

Whether you're an indie developer selling a SaaS starter kit or a team distributing internal tools under license, Uhpenry gives you the infrastructure to control access, manage buyers, and get paid — all in one place.

## What Uhpenry Offers

- **Gated-Source Access**  
  Control who can view, download, or clone your private repos or branches.

- **Stripe-Powered Payments**  
  Onboard as a seller, set your pricing, and receive payouts through Stripe Connect.

- **Teams and Permissions**  
  Add collaborators to your seller account and control roles per project.

- **Secure Snapshots**  
  Give buyers access to a snapshot of your project at time of purchase, even if the live repo changes later.

- **License-Based Distribution (Coming Soon)**  
  Upload license-bound software packages or API-based tools without exposing the full repo.

- **Analytics and Reviews**  
  Track views, conversions, and feedback across your projects.

## Integrations

Uhpenry is built with a tight integration to:

## Who Is It For?

Uhpenry is built for:
- Indie developers monetizing code directly
- Teams distributing licensed tools
- Open-source maintainers offering premium versions
- Agencies or freelancers packaging internal tools

## The Gated-Source Model

Open source isn’t the only way. Gated-Source sits between open and closed:
- Keep your code private
- Let only buyers and collaborators access it
- Retain full control over updates and access

We’re building infrastructure to support the next generation of developer entrepreneurship.
